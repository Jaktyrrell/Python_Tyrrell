#Your task is to write a program which reads the number of blocks the builders have, and outputs the height of the pyramid that can be built using these blocks.

#Note: the height is measured by the number of fully completed layers â€“ if the builders don't have a sufficient number of blocks and cannot complete the next layer, 
#they finish their work immediately.

#Enter number of blocks
blocks = int(input("Enter the number of blocks: "))

height = 0  # Initialize the height of the pyramid to 0
blocks_needed = 0  # Initialize the blocks needed for the current layer to 0

while blocks_needed <= blocks:
    height += 1  # Increment the height for each fully completed layer
    blocks_needed += height  # Calculate the blocks needed for the next layer

print("The height of the pyramid:", height - 1)
