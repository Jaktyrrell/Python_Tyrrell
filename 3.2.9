#The break statement is used to exit/terminate a loop.

#Design a program that uses a while loop and continuously asks the user to enter a word unless the user enters "chupacabra" as the secret exit word, in which case the message "You've successfully left the loop." 
#should be printed to the screen, and the loop should terminate.

#Don't print any of the words entered by the user. Use the concept of conditional execution and the break statement.

while True:
    user_input = input("Enter a word: ")  # Ask the user to enter a word
    
    if user_input == "chupacabra":
        print("You've successfully left the loop.")
        break  # Exit the loop if the user enters "chupacabra"
