#Your task here is even more special than before: you must redesign the (ugly) vowel eater from the previous lab and create a better, upgraded (pretty) vowel eater! 
#Write a program that uses:

#a for loop;
#the concept of conditional execution (if-elif-else)
#the continue statement.
#Your program must:

#ask the user to enter a word;
#use user_word = user_word.upper() to convert the word entered by the user to upper case; we'll talk about string methods and the upper() method very soon - don't worry;
#use conditional execution and the continue statement to "eat" the following vowels A, E, I, O, U from the inputted word;
#assign the uneaten letters to the word_without_vowels variable and print the variable to the screen.
#Look at the code in the editor. We've created word_without_vowels and assigned an empty string to it. 
#Use concatenation operation to ask Python to combine selected letters into a longer string during subsequent loop turns, and assign it to the word_without_vowels variable.

word_without_vowels = ""  # Variable that is an empty string to store uneaten letters

# Prompt the user to enter a word and assign it to the user_word variable.
user_word = input("Enter a word: ")

# Convert the user's word to uppercase
user_word = user_word.upper()

for letter in user_word:
    # Use conditional execution and the continue statement to "eat" the vowels
    if letter in "AEIOU":
        continue  # Skip this iteration if the letter is a vowel
    
    # Concatenate the uneaten letters (consonants) to word_without_vowels
    word_without_vowels += letter

# Print the word without vowels
print(word_without_vowels)
