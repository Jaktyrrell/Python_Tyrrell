#The continue statement is used to skip the current block and move ahead to the next iteration, without executing the statements inside the loop.

#It can be used with both the while and for loops.

#Your task here is very special: you must design a vowel eater! Write a program that uses:

#a for loop;
#the concept of conditional execution (if-elif-else)
#the continue statement.

# Prompt the user to enter a word and assign it to the user_word variable
user_word = input("Enter a word: ")

# Convert the user's word to uppercase
user_word = user_word.upper()

# Loop through each letter in the user's word
for letter in user_word:
    # Use conditional execution and the continue statement to "eat" the vowels
    if letter in "AEIOU":
        continue  # Skip this iteration if the letter is a vowel
    
    # Print the uneaten letters (consonants)
    print(letter)
